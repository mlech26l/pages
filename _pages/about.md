I am a PhD candidate at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/) at the research group of [Tom Henzinger](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/henzinger-group/).
My research topics is the intersection between Machine Learning, formal Verification, and Robotics.

My publications so far:
- **ICML** (2020) *The Natural Lottery Ticket Winner: Reinforcement Learning with Ordinary Neural Circuits*
- **IJCAR** (2020) *An SMT Theory of Fixed-Point Arithmetic*
- **ICLR** (2020) *Learning Representations for binary classification without backpropagation*
- **ICRA** (2020) *Gershgorin Loss Stabilizes the Recurrent Neural Network Compartment of an End-To-End Robot Learning Scheme*
- **TACAS** (2020) *How Many Bits Does it Take to Quantize Your Neural Network?*
- **ICRA** (2019) *Designing Worm-inspired Neural Networks for Interpretable Robotic Control*
